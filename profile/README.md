The European Covid-19 Forecast Hub is run in collaboration between the [Epiforecasts team](https://epiforecasts.io/covid), which is part of the [Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19) at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk), and the [European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC)](https://ecdc.europa.eu).

The Hub collates and combines short-term forecasts of Covid-19 across Europe (EU and EFTA countries and the UK) generated by different independent modelling teams using a wide range of approaches. The underlying approach was pioneered by the [Reich lab](https://reichlab.io/) and follows similar projects in the [USA](https://covid19forecasthub.org/) and in [Germany and Poland](https://kitmetricslab.github.io/forecasthub/forecast). Another related project is the [US scenario hub](https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/).
